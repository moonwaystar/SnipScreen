## Privacy Policy üîí

- **Data Usage**: Screenshots are processed locally and only stored temporarily in Chrome's local storage until edited and saved/shared. No data is sent to external servers.
- **Storage**: Temporary screenshot data is cleared when the editor is closed or the operation completes. Saved screenshots go to your configured location (default: "SnipScreen").
- **Clipboard**: Clipboard access occurs directly upon clicking "Share" (no confirmation required) but can be disabled via settings (stored in `chrome.storage.sync`).
- **Opt-Out**: You can disable clipboard or storage features via Chrome extension settings.

We respect your privacy and aim to keep all operations transparent and local.
